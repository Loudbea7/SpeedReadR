Speed Read-R by Loudbeat

Did you know you can read more than twice the speed of the average reading speed?

Press space to try it out!

Yes! Amazing! Isn't it?
Imagine how much more information you would be able to acquire in the same amount of time. In this era of increasing accessibility to more and more data, you must be quick in order to not fall behind all the new incoming streams of information the world produces every second.

Our eyes are a set of amazingly complex machines and together with our brains we are pretty much designed to recognize patterns and follow movements. The thing is that the text we read doesn't usually move, and so our eyes are the ones that have to work that part out. In consequence, when that happens we don't get new information until they stop to focus on a different spot and only then we can start to get the new image.

It may seem like you can move your eyes pretty fast, and removing that short amount of time wouldn't make the difference. So instead of taking my word for it, I'll encourage you to go out and do a speed reading test reading as you would typically read, and then make another one but using the Speed Read-R app.

In my case, I doubled the speed on the first try! Though I can't say it'll work the same for all, despite most of us having two eyes and one brain we are all different in our own ways. But I still think this could easily be a major improvement in the way we usually acquire information.

How about you? Will this become your new way of reading?
